/**
 * Turns a videoId into a URL ExoPlayer can actually stream.
 *
 * Three things make or break this, and the order they are attempted in matters
 * as much as the mechanics of each:
 *
 *  1. **Which endpoint asks.** The `youtubei/v1/player` POST is one small JSON
 *     round trip. The watch page — what a full extractor scrape fetches — is
 *     several hundred kilobytes of HTML and is rate-shaped: under load Google
 *     answers its headers immediately and then feeds the body out over tens of
 *     seconds, or simply stops sending and never closes. That shaping is
 *     invisible as an error and reads to a listener as endless buffering, so
 *     the scrape is kept off the hot path entirely — see [newPipeUrl], the
 *     failsafe of last resort.
 *
 *  2. **Which client asks.** Google turns identities away without notice and
 *     without pattern: the client that works today answers `LOGIN_REQUIRED`
 *     next month. So [CLIENTS] is walked rather than trusted, the one that last
 *     worked is tried first, and one that is refused for a track is stood down
 *     for that track for a while.
 *
 *  3. **Whether the URL is real.** Every googlevideo URL carries an `n`
 *     parameter which, sent as-is, gets the response throttled to a crawl or
 *     refused with 403; it has to be transformed by running YouTube's own
 *     player JavaScript, which is what NewPipe's [YoutubeJavaScriptPlayerManager]
 *     does. That can fail quietly, and a URL can be dead on arrival for reasons
 *     no amount of care predicts — so nothing is handed to the player, or
 *     cached, until a single byte has been fetched from it. See [probe].

     * away with no player JavaScript involved at all. [PlayerClient.ANDROID]
     * below them hands back ciphered formats, costing a download of that

     * TVHTML5 (Cobalt v7) is first because it works on flagged IPs without

     *
     * The whole thing is attempted twice, for the case where a client is turned
     * away with "Sign in to confirm you're not a bot": [playerStream] mints a
     * fresh visitor id and retries that one client, but `mintedFreshVisitor` is

     * cannot do: a client whose URL failed to probe was stood down by that
     * failure and is skipped on the way round again, so the second attempt is
     * the same walk minus its refusals, not a clean one. Bot checks it can fix;
     * refusals it cannot.
     *
     * Which is why extraction sits behind both. When every client is refusing
     * — the observed state, with the VR clients bot-checked and iOS minting
     * Opus URLs that 403 — [resolve] still gets audio, because it falls through
     * to NewPipe and re-derives the URL itself. A download reaching the same
     * wall has to do the same thing or it fails while the track it is refusing
